Welcome to GeoAI on HPC: from single-task paradigm to multiple-task Geoscience Foundation Models.
---

Welcome to the GeoAI on HPC Workshop, where you'll explore the evolving landscape of Geospatial Artificial Intelligence (GeoAI) on High-Performance Computing (HPC) environments. 

1. **Get Started with GeoAI.** You'll cover the foundational concepts of GeoAI, introduce what typical GeoAI tasks are and how AI are applied to geospatial data like satellite imagery. 
  * Foundational concepts of GeoAI
  * Typical GeoAI tasks
  * Foundation Models on Geosciences (GFMs)
  * Why GeoAI on HPC clusters
  * GeoAI datasets and GFMs available on Anvil

2. **Tools and Setup** You'll dive into the practical tools that enable this work, and set up working environment on HPC Clusters. You'll examine the TorchGeo library, which provides a comprehensive toolkit for training models on geospatial datasets within PyTorch. You'll also cover TerraTorch, a fine-tuning and benchmarking toolkit that extends capabilities for Geospatial Foundation Models.  


3. **Case Studies** You'll follow several case studies to understand the transition from traditional, single-task GeoAI models—like a model trained to identify specific land cover types—to the latest advancements in Geoscience Foundation Models. These larger, more versatile models are capable of performing perform specific geoscience tasks with much less new data than would be required for a traditional model.

  * A Case study of GFMs with TerraTorch: Prithvi-EO-2.0
  * A Case study of GFMs: Aurora
